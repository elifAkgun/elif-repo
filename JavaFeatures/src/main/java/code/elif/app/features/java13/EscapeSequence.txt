\"Schadenfreude is a word borrowed from German, and comes from schaden,\n
meaning harm, and freude, meaning joy. It's pronounced shaa-duhn-froy-duh,\n
and is that feeling of pleasure you get when something bad happens to someone else.\"\n

\"For example, it's the happy feeling you get when someone pushes you  \n
out of the way to catcha train and they miss it anyway â€” or when you see \n
that the smartest kid in your class failed a test that you passed easily.\"\n
